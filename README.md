### Hi there 👋

My name is Mario, I'm an Cloud-Native Engineer, living in Grenoble (French Alps 🏔️)

I am a web engineer living near Grenoble in the Alps. I have been coding since 2008 out of passion, and professionally for the past 10 years.

Since that time and the advent of Web 2.0, I have witnessed many revolutions, both fruitful and sterile, in the ever-changing world of web development.

From my beginnings with dynamic websites using the MVC paradigm with PHP and MySQL, to complex cloud-native distributed applications, I have experienced numerous technical revolutions:

* the emergence of MVVM and client-side apps, with increasingly powerful browsers.
* the industrialization and automation of delivery, to ship code faster and on a more relaible way.
* the shift to the Cloud, with more automation and considering the Fin and Sec aspects.
* the web back to SSR, and more generally, a new era where we are looking for simplicity and performance, to reduce the digital footprint.

And a lot of others ! the list would be too long, given how much has happened in our Tech microcosm over the past 15 years.

I enjoy learning new things and doing things to the best of my ability. I also love experimenting with new frameworks and techniques to form my own opinions about them.

I also have a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge with younger developers.

Apart from coding, I like:

* ⛷️ skiing
* 🪂 paragliding
* 🧗 climbing
* 🛼 rollerskates
* 🏀 basket-ball
